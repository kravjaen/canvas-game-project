Module 1: Game Creation 
:coffee: 

Both single player games. 

Option 1: Shell Game 
Create animation for cups, or utilize a pre-existing image. Try both. *Also, maybe choose a different item? 
Use sprites, like fireball, to mimic motion this time? 
* Select what item you will show user and want cup to “contain.” 
Classes: 1) Game 2) Single Player: 1. enable a spacebar event to trigger the game scramble and 2. a click event to select what cup the user believes the item is inside of, and then check condition if item is within 3) Have a number of rounds (*3) the user can play (increase difficulty by increasing speed of scramble and * potentially increase the number of objects  present to make it harder for the user to follow.) 
Set a randomize method to move around the cups.
Set a method for the item - * important: how to attach it to one of the cups, and ensure it follows the same cup/parent pattern, during the “scrambling.”
Set a speed method to shift cups. 
Score method for counting number of right and wrong user clicks.
Find ways to throw off user, but also not make it impossible.
Audio: Timer, buzzer sound towards the end.


Option 2: Under the Sea
Wave motion for fish, not just up and down and left and right but also a “leap” with spacebar.  
To capture:
To avoid: 
Water sounds.
